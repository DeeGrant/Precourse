# Feynman Writing Prompts - Homework 1

In a seprate text file that you create, write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old. Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding. Ask your questions on Slack.

Variables: are placeholders we use to store things we want to reference later

Strings: are a specifict type of thing that is most similar to writing or words
type of what?

Functions (arguments, return): are a set of commands we use multiple times so we creata a meta-variable out of it (arguments: are variable we pass into the function for the function to use. , return: is the command used within a function to tell the function what to 'spit out')


if statements: is a type of conditional operator/statement that checks to see if a certain critera is met; allowing the program to branch of in different directons depending on what occurs.

it's not a conditional operator it's a conditional statement

What is a statement? - an instruction executed by the computer.
	Statement: a line of code that tells the computer to do something
	Statement: a line of code that the computer reads in order to do something
	Which is closer? Does the computer read the code or the code tell the computer? Can both be happening (and thus a different descriptor is needed)? instructs
	Statement: an instruction for the computer to run
	Statement: 
What is a conditional statement? - an instruction (statement) whose result changes based on a truthy or falsy input
	Conditional Statement: a statement whose variable-outcome is based on truthy or falsy input
Program: a list of statements

Conditional (ternary) Operator [condition ? true-value: false-value]: an expression that allows one to define the response to both a true and false conditions. It's a shorter version of an if statement

What are operators? (that's a good question) - 
Type of operators (# of operands[things the operators act upon])
	* unary - one operand
	* binary - two operands
	* ternary - 3 operands
Several types (categories)
	* Assignment
	* Comparison
	* Arithmetic
	* Bitwise
	* Logical
	* String
	* Conditional (ternary)
	* Comma
	* Unary
	* Relational

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators]

What are expressions? - any valid unit of code that resolves to a value
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators]

if statements: a conditional statement that executes different statements based on a truthy or falsy condition

What is a condition? - boolean values?

Boolean values (true, false): the values used in Logic (true: affirmitive, false: negative)
What is Logic?

	* Variables
	* Strings
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
	* `if` statements
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)


	* Variables: are containers given unique names so that we can call/reference the value in them more easily
	what are values?
	are they containers? or references? What is the difference between a container and a reference?

	* Variables: are names given to specific values so that we can more easily find them when we need them

	* Variables: are named values

	* Variables: are values we have named so we can keep track of them/so we know where they are/so we can find them

	Javascript has 5 data types passed by value (also called primitive type), and 3 data types that are passed by reference (also called Objects). 
		* Primitives - Value 
			- Boolean
			- null
			- undefined
			- String
			- Number
		* Objects - References
			- Array
			- Function
			- Object

	Javascript equality (==) vs identity (===) operators
		* Equality (==)
			- performs type coercion: it will convert the comparators to the same type
		* Identity (===)
			- Strict Equality
			- Both the type and the value must be the same

	Six Falsy Values
		* false
		* 0 (zero)
		* "" (empty string)
		* null
		* undefined
		* Nan (Not a Number)
			- ins't equivalent to anything (not even itself)
